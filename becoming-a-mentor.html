            <h2>Mentoring at a Hackathon</h2>
            <p>People come to hackathons to learn new things and build cool
            stuff! Along the way, our hackers might run into technical
            difficulties, and will need the help of those more experienced with
            the technology they're working with. This is where our mentors come
            in, our mentors will be an elite team of volunteers and corporate
            sponsored devs standing by to help our hackers when issues
            arise.</p>
            <p>If you sign up to be a mentor, we'll ask you what technologies
            you are familiar with and will get you in touch with the hackers via
            a system known as <em>HelpQ</em>. In HelpQ, both hackathon
            participants and mentors will register in the system. Mentors will
            be able to list their areas of expertise. Participants who need
            assistance will submit a request, list the technologies that they're
            using, provide additional details about their problem, and give
            their location in the venue. Mentors will be able to see a
            list of all available requests and choose participants who
            need help in the mentor's areas of expertise. After helping a
            participant, mentors can either mark the request as resolved
            or return the request to the queue.  </p>
            <p>Overall, it's a great experience as you help someone build
            something wonderful, remember to <a
                   href="https://goo.gl/forms/ipmaTelKd5D1eY3f1">sign up</a> if
            you wish to volunteer as a mentor, and if you are affiliated with
            one of our sponsors, please email us at <a
                   href="mailto:sponsors@hacknc.com">sponsors@hacknc.com</a> to
               obtain the sponsored attendee form.</p>
